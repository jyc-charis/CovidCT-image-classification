Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 100 million individuals all over the world and caused more than 2 million deaths. One major hurdle in controlling the spreading of this disease is the inefficiency and shortage of medical tests. To mitigate the inefficiency and shortage of existing tests for COVID-19, we combine GAN and transfer learning(ViT) methods to diagnose COVID-19 based on CT images.
